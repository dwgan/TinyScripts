# TinyScripts
This is repository for updating some useful scripts for improving work efficiency 

## sort folder
This script is used to sort folder by size, which can not be realized at windows explorer. Other software like Treesize can also realize this kind of function. Unfuturenately, this script can not be executed by double cliking it directly, thus should be copy to run at Windows Powershell.

## setUTCtime
This script is used to set UTC time after restart Windows system if you install both Linux and Windows in the same machine. If you reenter Windows from Linux, the system time may be uncorrect due to different time standarlization (UTC or GMT).
